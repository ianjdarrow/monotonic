# monotonic

### Always-incrementing unique IDs based on timestamps

`monotonic` is a simple package to generate unique IDs based on timestamps. We use it to differentiate websocket messages generated by a single server that clients could receive duplicatively over multiple subscriptions.

By default, `monotonic` generates strings like:

```
1650627455:000000
1650627455:000001
1650627455:000002
1650627456:000000
```

...et cetera. There's also an constructor option to return results as numbers.

## Usage

```js
import Monotonic from "@ianjdarrow/monotonic";

const mono = new Monotonic({
  maxEventsPerBase: number, // default 1_000_000
  resolution: "seconds" | "ms", // default "seconds"
  outputFormat: "string" | "number", // default "string"
});
for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {
  mono.get(); // 1 million distinct IDs generated
}
```

`monotonic` will throw an error if you try to generate more than `maxEventsPerBase` per `resolution` (see "Options" below). By default this is 1,000,000 events per second.

Be aware: with `outputFormat: 'number'` and `resolution: 'ms'`, `maxEventsPerBase` can't exceed 1,000 (to avoid exceeding `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`).
